Hello and welcome! 
I'm a solo developer and I have been producing applications for years now. 
I started working on a mobile application and a website to support people that have a difficult time communicating. 
This is the reason of the "newConnected" studio. 
We want to help as many people as possible with this and hopefully create a world where everyone has someone to talk to even when you don't have someone to talk to. 
Thank you for joining and I hope I can help create a better world for us all.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: newConnected
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: they / them.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can code in 8 diffrent programming languages.
